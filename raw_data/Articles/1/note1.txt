The first publication is McCoy and Carpenter where they documented some interesting spatial and social patterning (see attached). The dataset is pretty small (n=253), with the artifacts recovered from 3 sites coming from 7 sources (see Table 3).  The temporal control is pretty coarse, and I think is associated with the “Late Period (1500–1769 A.D.)”.
